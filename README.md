# micro-grant-program
aVETars' Micro Grant Program for beginner and expert Vechain developers.

## Application Process

1. **Application Preparation and Submission**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/aVETarNFTs/micro-grant-program) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template ([`applications/application-template.md`](applications/application-template.md)). Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster its review process will be.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_, that is the Markdown file you created from the template.

2. **Preliminary Review**

   After its submission, an application enters the preliminary review stage where the council will check whether it is formatted correctly and includes all the requested information. The council will label the pull request as "ready for committee review" if the application passes the preliminary review.
   
3. **Committee Review**

   A 8 member council will evaluate and make decisions on all the applications passing the preliminary review. The commitee may conditionally accept an application with further requirements for clarifications and amendments. The applicant(s) must _address all the requirements_ via a new pull request. The application will then be accepted once the pull request is approved by one committee member. Final decisions made by the committee will be put on the website to notify applicants and the aVETar holder community will vote on funding. 

   The grant application can be amended at any time. However, this _necessitates a reevaluation by the committee_. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.
   
 ## Grant Council
 The responsibility of the Grant Council will be to review applications for viability and contribution to the community before they go to holder vote. They will hold approval rights to a multi-sig wallet on Vechain connected to the Micro Grant Funds. This way no one entity should hinder or manipulate the funding of this program.
 
 The current council members are: _TBA_
